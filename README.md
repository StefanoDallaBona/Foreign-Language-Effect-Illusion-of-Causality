# GitHub Repository for the Experiment on the Relationship Between the Illusion of Causality and the Foreign Language Effect

This GitHub repository contains all the supplementary materials for the experiment titled *"The Foreign Language Effect on the Illusion of Causality: A Replication Attempt and an Exploratory Analysis of the Mechanisms."* The project is also available on OSF (link to the project: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/hvgkx/?view_only=7098178875224cf3b0b6890b209432ea)). Please read the project and the related pre-registration to correctly access the following materials:

- **The "Back Translation" folder** contains the results of the back-translation procedure that we used to create two conditions in our experiment: one in Italian and one in English.
  
- **The "Design Analysis" folder** contains the procedure we used to determine a sample size for the two-group comparison and the priors that we intend to use to provide statistical evidence for both H0 and H1 (i.e., the prior for the BayesFactor ratio between the two models).
  
-  **The "Experiment" folder** contains the experiment code (PsychoPy).
    
- **The "Experiment Pipeline" folder** contains the R pipeline that will be used to extract a dataframe for the analysis from raw data.

- **The "Experiment Structure" folder** contains the flow diagram illustrating the routine sequence of the experiment, highlighting the language differences for the two groups involved.

-  **The "Experiment Variables" folder** contains the list of measured variables in the experiment.
  
- **The "Original Experiment Analysis" folder** contains the re-analysis of the original experiment on which we based our study.

- **The "Planned Exploratory Analysis" folder** contains a general schema for the exploratory part of our experiment.
 
- **The "Study Design" folder** contains the schemas of the design for our experiment.
