# GitHub Repository for the Experiment on the Relationship Between the Illusion of Causality and the Foreign Language Effect

This GitHub repository contains all the supplementary materials for the experiment titled *"The Foreign Language Effect on the Illusion of Causality: A Replication Attempt and an Exploratory Analysis of the Mechanisms."* The project is also available on OSF (link to the project: [OSF Project](https://osf.io/hvgkx/?view_only=7098178875224cf3b0b6890b209432ea)). Please read the project (available at **"Study Draft" folder**) and the related pre-registration to correctly access the following materials:

- **The "Back Translation" folder** contains the results of the back-translation procedure that we used to create two conditions in our experiment: one in Italian and one in English.
  
- **The "Design Analysis" folder** contains the procedure we used to determine a sample size for the two-group comparison and the priors that we intend to use to provide statistical evidence for both H0 and H1 (i.e., the prior for the BayesFactor ratio between the two models). Specifically, the "BFDA" file contains the Bayes Factor Design Analysis, whereas the "Distsimulation" file contains the simulations used to create the prior distribution for H1.
  
-  **The "Experiment" folder** contains the experiment code (PsychoPy and Psychojs), along with the resources for running the experiment.
    
- **The "Experiment Pipeline" folder** contains the R pipeline that will be used to extract a dataframe for the analysis from raw data.

- **The "Experiment Structure" folder** contains the flow diagram illustrating the routine sequence of the experiment, highlighting the language differences for the two groups involved.

-  **The "Experiment Variables" folder** contains the list of measured variables in the experiment.
  
- **The "Original Experiment Analysis" folder** contains the re-analysis of the original experiment on which we based our study.

- **The "Planned Exploratory Analysis" folder** contains a general schema for the exploratory part of our experiment.
 
- **The "Study Design" folder** contains the schemas of the design for our experiment.
