## Two group comparison

The study design is a simple 2-group comparison between participants (native Italians with moderate English fluency) who complete the experiment in Italian and those who complete it in English.

## Confirmatory vs. Exploratory

If the confirmatory hypothesis finds statistical support for a reduction of the illusion of causality in the English group, we aim to further explore the reasons for the observed reduction through the analysis of other measures collected in the experiment, using an exploratory approach.
